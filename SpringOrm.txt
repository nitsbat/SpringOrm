Advantages of Spring ORM

1) Less Code to write
2) Easy To Test.
3) Exception handling


In ORM approach what we actually do is like for every table or enitity , we have to make a class with member variables as
column name, then ORM will map these variables to the column value. We just need to make ORM that this class should be mapped 
to this table.

In spring ORM we have HibernateTemplate Class which have all the CRUD methods (save,update,insert,get), it provides
all the functionality to perform CRUD operations in database. So we need object of HibernateTemplate.

To get the HibernateTemplate object we have to get it from the SessionFactory which is an interface and we will take
its implementation from LocalSessionFactoryBean class.
Now when we make the LocalSessionFactoryBean object we need to give three things, 
first is the DataSource which is the
databse properties, second is the Hibernate properties like cache,ddl-auto property ; 
and the third property will be Annotated classes (like mapping classes with @Entity annotation)
